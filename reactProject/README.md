# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Prerequisites:
Make sure you have Git installed on your computer. If not, you can download and install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. If not, you can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en).
I also reccomend Git Bash terminal from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

   git clone <Repository_URL>
